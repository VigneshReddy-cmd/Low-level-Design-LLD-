# Low-level-Design-LLD-

Low-level system design is important because it deals with the nitty-gritty details of how a system actually works.
It helps ensure that the system is efficient, fast, and uses resources wisely.
Good low-level design also makes it easier to fix problems and make improvements to the system later on.
Overall, it's about making sure the system runs smoothly and performs well.
